      "p-2":"The history of rifled firearms begins in the 15th century, when the first hand-held arquebus was invented in Italy. Since then, it has been constantly improved and modernized, and by the end of the 19th century, it became the main type of firearm used in armies around the world.",
      "p-1":"Rifled firearms received the greatest development in the 19th century, thanks to the industrial revolution and new manufacturing technologies. This allowed for the mass production of high-quality rifled firearms, which were widely used in wars and conflicts.",
      "p0":"Throughout history, rifled firearms have been developed and improved, with new types and models appearing, as well as various improvements in design and materials used. Today, rifled firearms are available in various options, ranging from hunting rifles and carbines to sniper rifles and sports shotguns.",
      "p1": "A rifled weapon /s is a firearm that has screw grooves in the bore to give the projectile a rotational motion, which ensures its stability on the trajectory, flight range and accuracy of fire. At the time of the shot, the projectile's leading belt or bullet shell, made of soft metal (for example, brass or bimetal with a brass top layer), cuts into the helical grooves of the barrel bore. The diameter of a bullet for a rifled weapon must necessarily correspond to the diameter of the bore measured along the rifling (i.e., correspond to a larger diameter). In this case, a breakthrough of powder gases between the walls of the barrel and the bullet will not be allowed, due to which the projectile (bullet), moving in the bore, has the ability to rotate around its longitudinal axis and acquire rotational motion.",
      "p2": "The insertion of the shell of the bullet will be the easier, the narrower the fields (protruding parts) of the rifling. However, if the fields are too narrow, their width may turn out to be so small that they will not satisfy the strength limits and will collapse. Practically take the width of the field, equal to about half the width of the groove. The height of the protrusions on the shell of the bullet depends on the depth of the rifling. With small rifling, slight wear of the fields (protrusions) can lead to the bullets falling off the rifling. Based on this, the depth of the rifling is made as large as possible. However, as the depth of the rifling increases, the force required to cut the bullet into the rifling increases, which can cause the jacket to rupture or dismantle (destruct) the bullet. In addition, deep rifling creates large protrusions on the bullet jacket, which will increase the air resistance force in flight. Given all these considerations, the depth of the rifling is made equal to from 1/50 to 1/70 of the caliber of the weapon (1.5-2%).",
      "p3": "The bullet should cut into the rifling and fill them completely, to the very bottoms and a little (very little) with a surplus. Between the transverse dimensions of the bullet and the bore, a ratio must be observed in which the cross-sectional area of the bullet would be 1-2% higher than the cross-sectional area of the barrel. The bullet, freely, with backlash, going along the barrel, begins to “hang out” in it from wall to wall, breaks the barrel and deviates from the aiming direction. There will be no accuracy of battle with such bullets. Therefore, for each barrel, it is desirable to select a cartridge with a bullet of the appropriate diameter. Bullets of rifle cartridges are always made larger in diameter than the nominal caliber of the weapon, and even a little more than the distance between the bottoms of the rifling. Each actual diameter of a particular bore must match a particular bullet diameter.",
      "p4": "The direction of the rifling is found both right (Russia, USSR, Germany, America) and left (England and France). The right direction of the rifling is due to the fact that the pressure of the bullet on the combat edges of the rifling causes a torsion reaction of the barrel in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the bullet. These stresses are significant, and they can either twist (screw) the barrel into the receiver, or unscrew it from there. The usual technological thread in most countries of the world is right-hand rotation and, accordingly, a barrel with a right-hand direction of rifling will “screw” into the receiver, and not “get out” of it. English and French barrels with left-hand rifling have, respectively, a left-hand thread for connecting to the receiver.",
      "p5": "The direction of rotation of the rifling has no effect on the quality of the battle of the weapon (energy and accuracy). But it should be remembered that with the right rotation of the rifling, the deviation of the bullet to the derivation will be to the right, and with the left rotation - to the left.",
      "h1": "The shape of the rifling",
      "p6": "In the practice of small arms at different times and for various reasons, various rifling profiles were used: rectangular, trapezoidal, segmental, rounded and even combined.",
      "p7": "Rectangular /sis such a form of rifling, in which the faces of the same rifling are parallel. The advantages of this particular form of rifling are in its reliability, durability and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing, and therefore it is most used in weapon systems.",
      "p8": "The trapezoidal /s shape of the rifling is similar to a rectangular one and differs from it in that the adjacent faces of the rifling are not parallel to each other. This form of rifling is dictated by the desire to make the deformation of the shell of the bullet when cutting into the rifling less sharply “shifted” and, accordingly, maintain its profile and mechanical strength, increase the depth of the rifling and increase the pressure in the barrel. Trapezoidal rifling weapons are more difficult and expensive to manufacture than rectangular rifling weapons, but the accuracy of such barrels is better.",
      "p9": "The above forms of rifling, in principle, meet operational requirements, but the solid particles of the bullet shell and combustion products of gunpowder remaining in the corners of the rifling (between the bottom of the rifling and the edge) can cause corrosion, because cleaning and lubricating the corners of the rifling is difficult. In addition, the corners of the rifling are loosely filled with the mass of the bullet, and in these places a breakthrough of powder gases is observed. In this case, the pressure in the barrel decreases somewhat and the hot powder gases flowing through unfilled places at high speed have a destructive effect on the barrel.",
      "p10": "Trying to eliminate this drawback, so-called /ssegment-shaped/s rifling is still used on some weapon systems. This form of rifling is called segmental, in which rifling in a section perpendicular to the axis of the trunk represents the shape of a segment. With this form of rifling, which does not have corners, the bullet fills the lumen of the bore completely. But barrels with such rifling are very laborious and expensive to manufacture, moreover, in the absence of combat edges, on which the bullet usually rests when moving, the bullet acts on the supporting part of the segment, like a wedge, causing increased transverse deformation of the barrel and reducing its survivability. Therefore, segmental rifling is not widely used.",
      "p11": "At present, the understanding of /spolygonal /scutting is broader, it is understood as essentially any trunk that does not have clearly defined fields and grooves in its channel, instead of which the transitions between them are smoothed, so that in the cross section the bore resembles a polygon with rounded corners. Bullets for such a barrel are ordinary, rounded, and when fired, they deform according to the shape of its channel. The production of such barrels today is carried out by a fairly fast and cheap method of rotational forging, which makes it economically feasible. It is believed that polygonal rifling provides better obturation of powder gases, higher muzzle velocity (due to less resistance to its movement), more accurate bullet flight direction, and less barrel contamination.",
      "h2": "Types of rifling (sweep)",
      "p12": "The rifling resulting from the development of the barrel in the form of a /s straight line /s is called a rifling. The angle in the diagram that characterizes the slope or steepness of the rifling is called the angle of inclination or steepness of the rifling.",
      "p13": "A rifling, which, when developed, appears as a curved line with increasing steepness from the beginning of the rifling to the muzzle, is called a /s progressive rifling/s.",
      "p14": "The advantage of constant twist rifling is ease of manufacture, the disadvantage is uneven wear. With rifling of constant steepness, the pressure on the combat edge is variable and takes on an exceptionally large value at the moment when the pressure of the powder gases in the barrel is greatest. In the place of greatest pressure, increased wear of the combat edges of the rifling occurs.",
      "p15": "With progressive rifling at the highest pressure, the angle is the smallest, therefore, the pressure on the combat edge will also be relatively small. With a drop in pressure, closer to the muzzle with an increased steepness of the rifling, their combat edges will experience much less destructive forces when a bullet passes through them.",
      "p16": "Progressive rifling significantly improves the accuracy of the barrel battle, but they are not widely used in small arms due to the complexity of manufacturing and are used in artillery systems. Such rifling is performed on individual samples of highly accurate sniper weapons.",
      "h3": "Twist (thread pitch) of the barrel",
      "p17": "The length of the section of the barrel bore, on which the rifling of constant steepness makes one complete revolution, is called the/s rifling pitch or barrel twist/s. The rifling pitch is usually measured in inches and has the following entry in the technical description of the barrel - 1:14. As an example, this means that the bullet makes one complete rotation around its axis at a distance of 14 inches or 355 mm.",
      "p18": "It should be understood that the twist does not have to be less than or equal to the length of the barrel. For example, many handguns have a barrel twist of 20 inches (508 mm). In this case, the length of the barrel of the gun is much less. This means that the bullet completes its rotation around the axis already outside the muzzle.",
      "p19": "Knowing the length of the rifling pitch and the muzzle velocity of the bullet, it is possible to calculate the number of revolutions of the bullet around its axis at the moment of departure from the bore according to the formula:",
      "p20": "Angular velocity = muzzle velocity / twist",
      "p21": "Example. Determine the number of revolutions of a Mosin rifle bullet of the 1891-1930 model. Muzzle velocity 860 m/s, rifling pitch 0.24 m.",
      "p22": "Solution. 860/0.24 = 3583 revolutions per second.",
      "p23": "To determine the optimal correspondence between the size of a bullet and the twist of the barrel, there is the /sGreenhill formula/s. It was bred in 1879 by Sir Greenhill (Alfred George Greenhill, lived 1847-1927). It was first published in the British Textbook of Small Arms in 1929. Allows for a given caliber and a given bullet to calculate the optimal rifling pitch.",
      "p24": "T/s = thread pitch in inches",
      "p25": "K/s = Greenhill constant = 150 (for initial bullet speed from 457 to 853 m / s) and 180 - for initial. bullet speeds over 853 m / s and 125 - for pistols. These values of the constant are valid for lead bullets with a sheath made of copper or its alloy. The constant is rigidly tied to the density of the bullet material.",
      "p26": "D/s = bullet diameter in inches",
      "p27": "L/s = bullet length in inches",
      "p28": "T = (K * D2) / L",
      "p29": "Bullet length at a given twist : L = (K * D2) / T",
      "p30": "For example, for a .308 caliber bullet, 1.35 inches long (weight 200 grains or 13 grams), we get: (150 * 0.3082) / 1.35 = 10.54. That is a suitable twist 1:10.",
      "p31": "If the diameter of the bullet and its length are taken in the metric system, i.e. in millimeters, the constant does not change. Thus: (150 * 7.822) / 34.29 = 267.51 mm.",
      "p32": "You can also use the /sSierra Bullets formula:/s",
      "p34": "V/s - muzzle velocity, fps",
      "p35": "T/s = twist",
      "p36": "D/s = bullet diameter in inches",
      "p37": "L/s = bullet length in inches",
      "p38": "T = 0,06 * V * D2 / L",
      "p39": "For example: for a .308 caliber bullet, 1.35 inches long, with an initial velocity of 800 m/s, we get: 0.06 * 2624 * 0.3082 / 1.35 = 11,063",
      "p40": "The thickness of the barrel increases with a decrease in the pitch of the rifling and an increase in the revolutions of the gun. But to reasonable limits - if the cuts are too steep, the bullet will break away from them, and if the revolutions are too high, it can tear it apart with centrifugal force.",
      "h4": "Forms of the muzzle section of the barrel (muzzle chamfer)",
      "p41": "The muzzle of the barrel can be considered the boundary between internal and external ballistics. Its perpendicularity to the axis of the barrel bore, the evenness and clarity of the rifling exit have a very large impact on accuracy. The slightest dent will asymmetrically slow down the bullet, and therefore deflect it from the line of sight.",
      "p42": "To protect the muzzle from damage, it is usually processed in the form of a so-called /smuzzle chamfer/s - a recessed cone, when the outer edges of the barrel protrude around the muzzle and protect it from impacts.",
      "p43": "The muzzle chamfer ensures the simultaneous release of the bullet from the rifling at the time of the shot. In many ways, the accuracy of the weapon depends on the quality of the chamfer, on the correctness of its shape, because if the bullet is unevenly twisted, then it will fly along a spiral trajectory, and not along a (relatively) straight line.",
      "p44": "Formation of rifling in the bore",
      "p45": "Historically, the first way to make rifling in a bore was to /s cut rifling/s, and this method is still considered unsurpassed in terms of quality in many circles. Single-point trellis planing, performed on Pratt & Whitney sine saws, reached its perfection in the 1940s, after which it was replaced by faster and cheaper technologies.",
      "p46": "The planing method requires complex equipment, a lot of experience and a long time investment. However, it has undoubted advantages: first of all, planing does not introduce additional stresses into the barrel blank steel. It is also important that the planing method can be used to make any configuration of rifling in the trunk that the customer wants. You can specify the ratio of the area of the grooves and fields, their number, and also maintain the pitch of the grooves with an accuracy of a thousandth of an inch. You can experiment with so-called progressive twists, etc. - in other words, the possibilities here are almost limitless, if funds allow.",
      "p47": "Bartlein, Border, Brux, Hawk Hill Custom, Krieger, Obermeyer make trunks using the planing method.",
      "p48": "The second most popular and widespread method of making rifling in high-precision shooting is /sbutton rifling/s. Through a smooth bore, a solid “button” is pulled (sometimes pushed through) - a spindle-shaped mandrel made of tungsten carbide. With its protrusions, this “button” squeezes grooves-rifling into the steel, compacting and displacing the metal in these places.",
      "p49": "Cornering is a faster and cheaper way to get rifling than planing: it takes no more than a minute to make one trunk, and a burr machine is incomparably simpler and cheaper than a sine machine. It sounds great, but the technology itself is quite complex - it was debugged in the middle of the last century at Remington factories, including the notorious Mike Walker, the 'father' of the Remington 700 rifle. However, creating high-quality barrels using chiselling also has a lot of nuances.",
      "p50": "Firstly, steel has a 'memory effect' - so the 'button' of the mandrel has diameters several thousandths of an inch larger than necessary. Secondly, you need to monitor the uniformity of the passage of the 'button', for which it is very important to choose the right lubricant. In places where the steel of the barrel billet is harder, the button may move, and the depth of the cut here may be less than on the opposite side. And this is marriage. It is also difficult to maintain uniformity of twisting of the rifling when mandrelling. If slippage is allowed during production, and the rifling pitch, even if very slightly, changes from steep to flatter, such a barrel, alas, will not shoot accurately.",
      "p51": "Button riflingleaves a lot of stresses in the barrel, which must be removed by additional heat treatment. Still, it is not always possible to completely get rid of stress. As a result, during further operations with the barrel (formation of the contour, application of flutes), they can affect the form of local micro-changes in the geometry of its channel.",
      "p52": "Mandreled barrels are made by Anschutz, Benchmark, Broughton, Criterion, Douglas, Hart, Lilja, Lothar Walther, Schneider, Shilen, Spencer, Wilson Arms and many others. Of the manufacturers of factory rifles, this is, for example, Savage Arms.",
      "p53": "Finally, during the Second World War in Europe, an ultra-fast method of obtaining rifled barrels in industrial quantities was born and spread - /shammer forging/s. It was invented and developed, of course, by the Germans, who needed to produce a huge number of barrels for the MG42 and other machine guns. In the process of cold forging, a drilled blank is subjected to rotational forging around a mandrel with a mirror image of rifling, during this process it lengthens by a good third, also “thinning” by about a third and acquiring a complete barrel contour. Modern forging machines allow you to make the barrel of the required contour immediately with the chamber of the desired caliber - and all this literally in a matter of minutes.",
      "p54": "The deformation of steel during forging, on the one hand, strengthens it, due to which forged trunks are distinguished by enviable survivability. On the other hand, forging introduces a monstrous amount of stress into the steel of the barrel, which will be very difficult to remove even by double tempering or cryogenic treatment. As a result, in the shooting sport, the attitude towards forged barrels has developed ambiguously: someone considers them the best barrels of all, while others do not take them seriously at all. Also note that forged barrels are usually made of chromium-molybdenum steel - the 416th “stainless steel” is poorly cold forged, and instead of it steel grade 410 with a slightly reduced chromium content is used.",

      "p55": "It should be noted in particular that barrel forging is the lot of large arms corporations that need maximum productivity and a large number of barrels. After all, cold forging cannot be done in a small workshop: a modern forging machine costs up to a million dollars! Therefore, forging barrels is made only by companies that produce weapons in large quantities. These are Remington, Ruger, Steyr, Sako, FN, Heckler & Koch, Sauer, Blaser and a number of others.",
